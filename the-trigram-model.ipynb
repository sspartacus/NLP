The reality is different though Such shops exist all over the world also in countries like the United States or Italy. The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture or it has to do with activities done at home in the context of the family.

This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation the two phenomena have made it more visible at best.\n\n# Child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children like guarding other children or helping here and there.
